\title{Infer self-transitions as residual probabilities}
\usage{
infer_self_transitions(p_list, from_states, to_states, delim = "->")
}
\arguments{
\item{p_list}{A named list of numeric vectors representing transition probabilities.}

\item{from_states}{Character vector of origin states (transient).}

\item{to_states}{Character vector of possible destination states.}

\item{delim}{Character delimiter used in transition names. Default is \code{"->"}.}
}
\value{
A modified \code{p_list} with self-transition vectors (e.g., \code{"P->P"}) added or updated.
}
\description{
For each transient state, calculates the remaining probability after all defined outflows and assigns it to the self-transition (e.g., \code{"P->P"}).
}
